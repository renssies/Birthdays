# Birthdays

A simple application that shows a list of your contacts and their birthday, it also shows their age if available. 

It's an expirement and app for personal use, so the code isn't the best...

### Why? 

A lot of people use Facebook to track people's birthdays, but people are leaving Facebook and I personally don't like Facebook. Therefore, as soon as I know someone's birthday, I add it to the contacts app instead. 

### Why SwiftUI?

Simple: I wanted to expirement with SwiftUi

### Can I use this app?

Yes, feel free to use the app personally or use it as a base for your own SwiftUI app.
